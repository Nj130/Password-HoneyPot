what this system does?

A Password HoneyPot (honeytoken) system plants fake credentials (user:password pairs, API keys, AWS creds, DB connection strings, saved‑password entries, config entries, etc.) in places an attacker would look. Legitimate users never use these credentials; any authentication attempt or use is a high‑confidence indicator of compromise, which then triggers an alert to your SOC/ops team. This is a well-known deception technique (aka honeytokens / canarytokens).

Short threat model & legal/ethical note

These tokens must be deployed only on systems you own/operate or where you have explicit permission. Planting them on third‑party systems or other people's machines is unauthorized and may be illegal.

Honeytokens are detection tools, not a replacement for hardening/patching. Use them to detect credential harvesting and lateral movement.
